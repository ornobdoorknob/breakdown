### Explanation
This application is developed using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. This approach separates the game's core logic (Model), user interface (View), and user interactions (Controller), promoting a clean and organized codebase. The Model handles the game's state, such as the board, ship positions, and game rules. The View manages the graphical user interface, providing a visually appealing black and green theme with interactive components and customization. The Controller mediates between the Model and View, processing user inputs, such as ship placements and attacks, and updating the View accordingly. The application is fully documented with Javadoc.
